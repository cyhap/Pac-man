Codename: Pac-man 

## Project Overview
This final project for 'ENPM808X: Software Development for Robotics' encompasses an autonomous robot product idea and follows high-quality software engineering practices and agile development utilized to build a simulated robotic system and demo using ROS and Gazebo. For our software design project, we are developing a collection robot. This robot will act vaguely similar to the arcade game character, Pac-man (which is also what we have used for the codename of our project), moving around a defined enclosed map, though in this case, autonomously, and collecting specific objects while ignoring others. The operating scenario for our design is one of the assembly rooms at the fictional ACME Robotics headquarters. The robot will maneuver its way through the design space, which will contain permanent objects like tables and walls with which it will have to avoid colliding. The source of the problem for which we have created a solution is that ACME has many employees that drop items on the floor throughout the day. Some of these items are potentially hazardous to the workflow (think banana peels), while others are important tools that have been placed there on purpose (think tools). Our collection robot will search the space, utilizing localization techniques and image processing to find and collect the waste objects, while ignoring other objects and avoiding all obstacles.
