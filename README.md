Codename: Pac-man 

# Overview
This project encompasses an autonomous robot product idea and follows high-quality software engineering practices and agile development to build a simulated robotic system and demo using ROS and Gazebo. We will be creating the software and simulation for a collection robot, which will utilize image processing and localization techniques to find and collect specific objects, while ignoring other objects and avoiding obstacles.

# Initial Design
UML Activity & Class diagrams for our initial design have been created, and define the springboard for our code structure and program flow.
